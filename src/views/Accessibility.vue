    </h1>
    <p>
      In order to provide excellent service to all of our users, including those with disabilities, the OurResearch
      websites, products, and services aim to provide an accessible experience for users of all abilities. OurResearch
      has developed our websites and products with accessibility in mind. This Accessibility Statement applies to these
      tools and websites:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin: 10px 0px 30px 30px;">
      <li><a href="https://unsub.org">unsub.org</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://unpaywall.org">unpaywall.org</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://ourresearch.org">ourresearch.org</a></li>
      <li>Other websites and tools created and hosted by OurResearch</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Conformance status</h2>

    <p>
      Our improvements are guided by relevant portions of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, Level AA and
      other recommendations. We have included accessibility features such as: navigability without use of a keyboard,
      text alternatives for non-text content, and assigned language for web pages. OurResearch websites are partially
      conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform
      to the accessibility standard.
    </p>
